# OpenChess User Manual (v1.0.0-rp2040 firmware)

This is the user manual for the **patched [`semichcsc-byte/Open-Chess`](https://github.com/semichcsc-byte/Open-Chess) firmware** running on a Concept-Bytes PCB + Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect.

If you're reading this with the original Concept-Bytes firmware, several features described here won't work. [Flash the patched firmware](../README.md#quick-start) first.

## First boot

When you power on the board (USB-C to the Arduino, or external 5 V to J1 if you've populated it):

1. **LEDs all off** for a moment while the firmware boots.
2. **Self-tests run** (see [Self-tests](#self-tests)) — pure software, no LED activity unless something fails.
3. **WiFi AP `OpenChessBoard` starts** (password `chess123`). You can ignore this; the AP is only useful for a future web UI.
4. **4 white LEDs light up in the centre of the board** — this is the [mode selection](#mode-selection) menu.

If the board flashes red 5 times immediately after boot, **the self-tests failed** — your firmware is broken. Re-flash the latest release.

---

## Mode selection

After boot, four white LEDs light up in the centre of the board. Each LED is a button: **place any chess piece on top of one to select that mode**.

```
   a   b   c   d   e   f   g   h
 8 .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .  8
 7 .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .  7
 6 .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .  6
 5 .   .   .   ⚪  ⚪  .   .   .  5     ⚪ = white selector LED
 4 .   .   .   ⚪  ⚪  .   .   .  4
 3 .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .  3
 2 .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .  2
 1 .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .  1
```

| LED | Internal coordinates | Mode |
|-----|----------------------|------|
| **D5** | row 3, col 3 | 1 — Human vs Human |
| **E5** | row 3, col 4 | 2 — Human vs AI (Stockfish) |
| **D4** | row 4, col 3 | 3 — Coming Soon (placeholder) |
| **E4** | row 4, col 4 | 4 — Sensor Test |

> **Tip:** the four selector LEDs form a 2×2 square at the very centre of the board. With the white pieces (rank 1) closer to you, the LEDs are arranged as:
>
> ```
>  Human vs Human (D5)   Human vs AI (E5)         ← back row of selector
>  Coming Soon    (D4)   Sensor Test (E4)         ← front row of selector
> ```

After selection:

- The 4 selector LEDs go off
- A green flash confirms the choice
- The mode-specific intro animation plays
- For Human-vs-Human and Human-vs-AI: the board waits for you to set up all 32 pieces in starting position before allowing moves

---

## Game mode 1 — Human vs Human

### Setting up

1. Select Human vs Human (place a piece on **D5**).
2. The 32 starting squares slowly light up in dim white as you place each piece. **You must place all 32 pieces** before the game starts.
3. When the board is fully set up, a **fireworks animation** plays. Game on.

### Making a move

1. **Lift a piece** of the colour whose turn it is (white starts).
   - The square you lifted from glows **dim white**.
   - Every legal destination glows **soft white** (quiet move) or **red** (capture).
   - For en-passant captures, the destination glows **pink**.
   - If you lift a piece that has **no legal moves** (e.g. a pinned piece), the square blinks twice and you must replace it.
2. **Place the piece on a legal destination**, OR **return it to its original square** to cancel.
3. The destination flashes **green** twice to confirm.
4. Turn switches to the other colour.

> **The firmware enforces all chess rules.** You cannot make an illegal move because illegal squares simply aren't lit. This includes:
> - Pieces pinned against your own king
> - Moves that leave your king in check
> - Castling through attacked squares
> - Castling while in check
> - Castling after the king or rook has moved (rights tracked in `GameState`)

### Castling

Both kingside (O-O) and queenside (O-O-O) castling work:

1. Lift your king. If castling is legal, you'll see white LEDs **two squares away** on the king's flank (g1/g8 for kingside, c1/c8 for queenside) in addition to the normal one-square king moves.
2. Place the king on the castling target square.
3. The board lights up the rook's source and destination — **move the rook to complete the castle** (h1→f1 or a1→d1, mirror for black).
4. Done.

The board prevents any of the FIDE-illegal castles automatically:

- King has moved
- Rook on that side has moved (or has been captured on its starting square)
- King is in check
- King's path is attacked
- Squares between king and rook are not empty

### En passant

If your opponent just made a 2-square pawn advance and your pawn is adjacent:

1. Lift your pawn.
2. The diagonal destination behind their pawn glows **pink** (instead of white) — this is the en-passant target.
3. Place your pawn there.
4. The captured pawn's square is shown briefly in red. **Remove the captured pawn** from the board to complete the move.

The window is exactly one move — if you don't take the en-passant immediately, the right is lost.

### Promotion choice

When your pawn reaches the back rank:

1. The destination square lights up gold.
2. **Four selector LEDs light up on your own back rank** (rank 1 for white, rank 8 for black) on files a, b, c, d:

   | File | Colour | Promotes to |
   |------|--------|-------------|
   | **a** | Gold | Queen |
   | **b** | Red | Rook |
   | **c** | Blue | Bishop |
   | **d** | White | Knight |

3. **Place any chess piece on one of the four selector squares.**
4. Lift the selector piece off when prompted. The pawn is now treated as the chosen piece for the rest of the game (you can swap the physical pawn for a queen, but the firmware doesn't require it — it tracks the promoted type internally).

### Check, checkmate, draws

- **Check:** the king square blinks red 3 times. The next move must remove the check (block, capture, or move king).
- **Checkmate:** game over animation plays. White wins → entire board glows white. Black wins → red pulse 3×.
- **Stalemate / 50-move rule / insufficient material:** fireworks animation. The board prints `DRAW - <reason>` on the serial monitor.

To start a new game after game over: lift all the pieces and re-select a mode (the board auto-resets state).

> **Not yet implemented:** 3-fold repetition (would require position hashing + history; possible but uses more RAM).

---

## Game mode 2 — Human vs AI (Stockfish)

### Prerequisites

- WiFi credentials configured in `arduino_secrets.h` and the firmware re-flashed (see [WiFi & AI mode setup](#wifi--ai-mode-setup)).
- Internet access to `stockfish.online` (HTTPS).

### Starting

1. Place a piece on **E5** (the Human vs AI selector).
2. The board prints the bot difficulty (Medium = Stockfish depth 10 by default).
3. The board tears down its own AP, then connects to your home WiFi.
   - On success: 3 brief green flashes across the entire board.
   - On failure: 5 red flashes, AI mode is unavailable until next reboot. See [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).
4. Set up the 32 pieces in starting position. Fireworks play. White (you) starts.

### Playing

- You play **white**. The bot plays **black**.
- Make your move exactly as in [Human vs Human](#making-a-move).
- The board sends the position (FEN) to the Stockfish API and waits for the bot's response (typically <2 s for Medium, longer for Hard/Expert).
- The bot's intended move is shown on the board:
  - **Source square** blinks white.
  - **Destination square** glows white.
- **You make the move physically:** lift the bot's piece from the source, place it on the destination.
- The board confirms with green flashes. Your turn again.

### What if the bot's move is illegal?

The patched firmware **validates every API response locally** with the chess engine. If Stockfish ever returns a move that isn't legal in the current position (corrupt response, partial JSON, side-of-turn confusion), the board:

- Prints `Bot move <xxxx> rejected by local engine` to serial
- Returns the turn to you (you don't lose your move)
- Stays in the current position

This protects against silent state corruption.

### Difficulty

By default the bot plays at Medium (Stockfish depth 10, ~25 s timeout). Easy/Hard/Expert are wired in `chess_bot.cpp::ChessBot()` constructor and `stockfish_settings.h`:

| Difficulty | Stockfish depth | Timeout |
|---|---|---|
| Easy   | 6  | 15 s |
| Medium | 10 | 25 s |
| Hard   | 14 | 45 s |
| Expert | 16 | 60 s |

To change difficulty you currently need to edit `chess_bot.cpp` and re-flash. A future revision could pick the difficulty from the 4 selector squares post-mode-select.

### What's not yet implemented in AI mode

- **Promotion choice for the player.** When your pawn reaches the back rank in AI mode, it auto-promotes to Queen. (The Stockfish API string includes a 5th promotion char like `e7e8q` but the parser only takes the first 4 chars; bolting on the 5th is a small follow-up.)
- **Showing the bot's promotion choice on the LED.** Same reason.

---

## Game mode 3 — Coming Soon

This is a placeholder for a future game mode (likely a chess puzzle / tactics trainer). Selecting it just prints a message and returns to the menu when you lift the piece.

> **Note:** in the original Concept-Bytes firmware, this mode caused an infinite loop spamming serial and freezing the menu while the piece was on the square. The patched firmware fixes that — it waits for you to lift the piece before re-arming the menu.

---

## Game mode 4 — Sensor Test

Place a piece on **E4**. The board enters a continuous loop where every square that has a magnet on it lights up blue.

Use this to:

- Test that all 64 hall sensors detect their magnet
- Diagnose dead zones (squares that don't light up even with a magnet)
- Verify magnet polarity (A3144 sensors are unipolar — only the **south pole** triggers them; if a piece doesn't register, flip it over)

To exit: power-cycle the board (no menu return from this mode).

---

## WiFi & AI mode setup

The pre-built `.uf2` does **not** include WiFi credentials — we can't ship binaries with someone else's password baked in.

### One-time setup

1. **Clone the firmware fork:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/semichcsc-byte/Open-Chess.git
   cd Open-Chess
   git checkout v1.0.0-rp2040
   ```

2. **Copy the secrets template:**

   ```sh
   cp arduino_secrets_template.h arduino_secrets.h
   ```

3. **Edit `arduino_secrets.h`:**

   ```c
   #define SECRET_SSID "YourWiFiName"
   #define SECRET_PASS "YourWiFiPassword"

   // Stockfish API — these defaults work, no change needed
   #define STOCKFISH_API_URL  "stockfish.online"
   #define STOCKFISH_API_PATH "/api/s/v2.php"
   #define STOCKFISH_API_PORT 443  // HTTPS
   ```

4. **Install dependencies (one-time):**

   ```sh
   arduino-cli core install arduino:mbed_nano
   arduino-cli lib install "Adafruit NeoPixel"@1.14.0
   arduino-cli lib install WiFiNINA
   ```

5. **Compile and upload:**

   ```sh
   # Find the port:
   arduino-cli board list
   # Then (replace usbmodemXXX with yours):
   arduino-cli compile --fqbn arduino:mbed_nano:nanorp2040connect .
   arduino-cli upload --fqbn arduino:mbed_nano:nanorp2040connect -p /dev/cu.usbmodemXXX .
   ```

The firmware now has your WiFi baked in and AI mode will work.

> **`arduino_secrets.h` is `.gitignore`d** in this repo — you can safely commit other firmware changes without leaking your WiFi password.

### How the bot reaches Stockfish

```
Board (Nano RP2040, station mode)
   │
   │ HTTPS GET /api/s/v2.php?fen=…&depth=10
   ▼
Your home router
   │
   ▼
stockfish.online (Cloudflare-fronted)
   │ Returns JSON: {"success":true, "bestmove":"bestmove e2e4 ponder d7d5", …}
   ▼
Board parses, validates, applies move
```

There's no server you need to host — `stockfish.online` is a free public API. Latency is typically < 2 s for depth 10.

---

## Self-tests

Every boot, before WiFi setup, the firmware runs **10 deterministic chess engine tests** and prints results to serial at 9600 baud:

```
=== ChessEngine self-tests ===
PASS T1: e2 pawn has 2 legal moves
PASS T2: b1 knight has 2 legal moves
PASS T3: no check at start
PASS T4: Fool's Mate detected
PASS T5: pinned rook stayed on file
PASS T6: both castlings legal
PASS T7: no castling in check (or fail above)
PASS T8: en-passant offered
PASS T9: K vs K is draw
PASS T10: kingside castle layout correct
=== Self-tests complete: 10/10 passed ===
```

If any test fails:

- The board flashes **red 5 times across all 64 LEDs** (impossible to miss)
- A `WARNING: N engine self-tests FAILED` line is printed
- The board still continues to boot, but you should re-flash a clean release because the engine is broken

The tests cover: pseudo-legal move generation, legal-move filtering (own-check), Fool's Mate detection, pinned-piece handling, castling rights, castling-in-check forbidden, en-passant, insufficient material, and `applyMove` correctness for castling.

These caught a **real bug during development** (a wrong test fixture) and would catch any regression in the engine before it reaches a game.

## Troubleshooting

### "AI mode does nothing when I select it"

Check the serial monitor (9600 baud).

| Symptom in serial | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| No `=== Starting Chess Bot Mode ===` line | You placed the piece on the wrong selector. | E5 = AI (not D5/D4/E4). |
| Stops at `Connecting to WiFi...` | You're running the **unpatched** Concept-Bytes firmware (AP+STA conflict). | Flash v1.0.0-rp2040. |
| `Connection attempt 10/10 - Status: ...` then red flash | Wrong WiFi credentials, or 5 GHz network. WiFiNINA only supports 2.4 GHz. | Edit `arduino_secrets.h`, switch to a 2.4 GHz SSID. |
| `Failed to connect to Stockfish API` | Internet blocked, DNS issue, or `stockfish.online` is down (rare). | Try `curl https://stockfish.online/api/s/v2.php?fen=…&depth=6` from your laptop. |
| `Bot move XXXX rejected by local engine` | Stockfish returned an illegal move (rare; Cloudflare hiccup). | Just play your turn again — the board returned the turn to you. |

### Sensors flicker / wrong piece detected

- The patched firmware adds **debounce (3 consecutive scans)**. If you still see flicker:
  - Slow down piece movement
  - Verify the piece's magnet hasn't fallen off
  - Try the Sensor Test mode to find the bad squares
- If the **same square** consistently fails to detect:
  - Magnet polarity wrong on that piece (flip it)
  - Hall sensor (A3144) damaged on that square — visible as no detection in Sensor Test
  - PCB trace or solder joint issue

### LEDs not lighting up

- The Arduino Nano RP2040 powers the LEDs from its own 3.3 V supply via a level shifter. If you see no LEDs at all:
  - Check the LED data line on D17 (NeoPixel `DIN`)
  - Re-seat the Arduino in its socket
  - Try the Sensor Test mode to force LEDs on

### Board freezes mid-game

If the firmware freezes (no serial output for 30+ seconds):

- Power-cycle (unplug USB, plug back in)
- Re-flash the latest release in case of corruption
- Open an issue with the serial output in [the firmware repo](https://github.com/semichcsc-byte/Open-Chess/issues)

### "I picked the wrong mode by mistake"

Some modes (Sensor Test, AI mode after WiFi connect) don't have a back-to-menu option. **Power-cycle the board** to return to mode selection.

For mode 3 (Coming Soon), just lift the piece — the patched firmware returns to the menu automatically.

---

## Resetting the board

| What you want | How |
|---|---|
| Restart current game | Lift all pieces, set up starting position again. The state auto-resets after game over. |
| Force back to mode selection | Power-cycle (unplug + replug USB). |
| Clear all state and re-flash firmware | Double-tap reset button → drag fresh `.uf2` to `RPI-RP2` drive. |
| Reset to factory firmware | Flash the original Concept-Bytes binary (not recommended — known bugs). |

---

## Coordinate system

The firmware uses an **internal `(row, col)` coordinate system** that maps to standard chess notation as follows:

| Internal | Chess notation |
|---|---|
| `row 0` | rank 1 (white back rank: `RNBQKBNR`) |
| `row 1` | rank 2 (white pawns) |
| `row 2-5` | empty middle ranks |
| `row 6` | rank 7 (black pawns) |
| `row 7` | rank 8 (black back rank) |
| `col 0` | file `a` |
| `col 7` | file `h` |

So the white king's home square `e1` is internally `(0, 4)`, and the black queen `d8` is `(7, 3)`.

The serial output uses standard algebraic notation (`e2`, `d4`, `Qh4#`, …) so you don't usually need to think in `(row, col)`.
