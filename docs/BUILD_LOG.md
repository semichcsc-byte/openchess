## 2026-05-11 — AI mode debug & upstream PR

- Symptom: selecting AI mode "did nothing" — board appeared frozen.
- Step 1 — wrong selector: serial showed I was placing the piece on `(4,3) = D4 = Game Mode 3 (Coming Soon)`, a placeholder. AI mode is `(3,4) = E5`.
- Step 2 — real bug found: even on the right square, `chess_bot.cpp::connectToWiFi()` calls `WiFi.begin()` directly without ever shutting down the AP that `WiFiManager::begin()` started in `setup()`. WiFiNINA on the Nano RP2040 Connect (and Nano 33 IoT / MKR WiFi 1010) cannot run AP and STA simultaneously → `WiFi.begin()` silently never returns `WL_CONNECTED`.
- Patch: `WiFi.disconnect(); WiFi.end(); delay(2000);` before `WiFi.begin()`.
- Verified: bot connects on attempt 1, gets IP `192.168.0.99`, Stockfish API responds (`bestmove d7d5`), full game playable.
- Also confirmed Stockfish API is up: `curl https://stockfish.online/api/s/v2.php?...` returns `{"success":true,...}`.
- Submitted upstream as **PR [Concept-Bytes/Open-Chess#9](https://github.com/Concept-Bytes/Open-Chess/pull/9)** (`fix/wifi-ap-sta-transition`, closes #5).
- Surveyed forks: 24 total. Only **[joojoooo/OpenChess](https://github.com/joojoooo/OpenChess)** is actively maintained (16 stars, last commit today, ESP32-based, Lichess + Web UI + OTA). [KhachDavid/smart-chessboard](https://github.com/KhachDavid/smart-chessboard) is a stockfish-only fix-fork, abandoned since Sep/2025.
- Upstream `Concept-Bytes/Open-Chess`: 0 PRs ever merged, last commit Aug/2025, 7 open issues (incl. #5) → effectively abandoned. PR #9 will sit in queue but is searchable for the next person hitting the bug.

## 2026-05-11 (later) — RP2040 quality pass (Phase 1)

Kept hardware as-is (Nano RP2040 + Concept-Bytes PCB) and focused on fixes that benefit every user with the same setup. 5 patches in [PR #10](https://github.com/Concept-Bytes/Open-Chess/pull/10):

1. **`stockfish_settings.h`**: `medium()` depth 6 → 10 (Easy and Medium were identical despite different banner)
2. **`chess_bot.cpp::parseStockfishResponse`**: split HTTP headers from body before scanning for JSON — Cloudflare's `Nel:` and `Report-To:` headers contain JSON-shaped values that the old `indexOf("{")` was grabbing
3. **`chess_bot.cpp::makeBotMove`**: validate API move locally before mutating state, return turn to player on any failure path (no more frozen `botThinking`)
4. **`OpenChess.ino` MODE_GAME_3**: replace 3s blind loop with wait-until-piece-lifted gate; eliminates serial spam and lets user recover without reboot
5. **`chess_engine.h`**: introduce `MAX_MOVES_PER_PIECE` constant; was inconsistent (`moves[27]` in chess_bot, `moves[28]` everywhere else — off-by-one buffer overflow risk)

Compile: `Sketch uses 144717 bytes (0%) of program storage space, +337 bytes vs PR #9 baseline`. Verified by upload + serial monitor: boot clean, mode selection works, no regressions on working paths. Local belt-and-suspenders defence in `.gitignore` against `arduino_secrets.h` even if `upstream-firmware/` ignore is ever removed.

Next (Phase 2, optional): chess rules completeness — check detection, pinned pieces, checkmate, castling, en passant. All RP2040-friendly, all in pure C++.

## 2026-05-11 (evening) — Phase 2 + Phase 3 in one go

Decision to keep the Nano RP2040 hardware and serve all Concept-Bytes Kickstarter backers with the same setup. Big batch of changes upstreamed as [PR #11](https://github.com/Concept-Bytes/Open-Chess/pull/11) (+1107 / -282 lines, 9 files).

**Phase 2 — chess rules:**
- Check / checkmate / stalemate detection with on-board animations
- Legal-move filtering (no more pinned-piece moves that expose own king)
- Castling (kingside + queenside, full FIDE rules including king-not-in-check + king-doesn't-pass-through-attacked-square)
- En passant (pink LED hint on EP target, applyMove removes the right pawn)
- 50-move rule + insufficient material draw (K-vs-K, K+minor-vs-K)
- Promotion choice via 4 LEDs on player's back rank (a=Q, b=R, c=B, d=N) in Human-vs-Human; bot mode still auto-Q

**Phase 3 — UX polish:**
- Sensor debounce: 3 consecutive identical reads required (eliminates the piece-flicker on board setup we saw in serial)
- AP `OpenChessBoard` shut down when entering non-WiFi modes (saves ~100mA, removes orphan WiFi network)
- 10 self-tests run at every boot before WiFi setup — PASS/FAIL printed to serial, red flash on failure

**Engine architecture refactor:**
- New `GameState` struct (castling rights, EP target, halfmove clock, last move)
- `getLegalMoves`, `isInCheck`, `isSquareAttacked`, `hasAnyLegalMove`, `getGameResult`, `applyMove`, `runSelfTests`
- All board mutation now goes through `ChessEngine::applyMove` so castling/EP/state can never be missed

**Validation: 10/10 self-tests passing** at boot (initial pawn moves, knight moves, no false check, Fool's Mate, pinned rook, both castlings, castle-in-check forbidden, en-passant, K-vs-K draw, kingside castle layout). Compile: 150679 bytes (0% of 16MB), 44640 bytes RAM (16%). Tested on hardware: chess_moves opens + plays through check + castles correctly; chess_bot still connects via #9 and applies validated moves.

Known follow-ups (kept out of scope): 5-char promotion parsing for bot mode (`e7e8q`), 3-fold repetition (needs position hashing + history).

## 2026-05-11 (later, again) — v1.1.0-rp2040: column-mirror bug + UX overhaul

Released as [v1.1.0-rp2040](https://github.com/semichcsc-byte/Open-Chess/releases/tag/v1.1.0-rp2040). Two themes:

### 🐛 The column-mirror coordinate bug

During testing of the new 2-selector menu (D5 = HvsH, E4 = AI), the LEDs were showing in D4 / E5 instead. Built an interactive 4-corner calibration sketch to find out why.

Results:
```
h1 -> sensor (0, 0)   expected (0, 7)
a1 -> sensor (0, 7)   expected (0, 0)
a8 -> sensor (7, 7)   expected (7, 0)
h8 -> sensor (7, 0)   expected (7, 7)
```

Diagnosis: **the Concept-Bytes PCB v1 wires file `a` to the rightmost shift-register column** (and file `h` to the leftmost). The upstream firmware never accounted for this. Every chess move printed to serial had its file letter mirrored across the a-h axis. The board worked because the mirror was self-consistent, but:
- Serial debug logs were misleading (`Player moved P from a7 to a5` actually meant `h7-h5`)
- Stockfish FEN strings were technically wrong (engine got mirrored positions; replied with valid mirrored moves)
- Any future Web UI / PGN export would have shown the wrong notation

Fix: encapsulated at the driver layer in [`board_driver.cpp`](https://github.com/semichcsc-byte/Open-Chess/blob/main/board_driver.cpp) — both `readSensors()` and `getPixelIndex()` now mirror `col` to `7 - col`. **All 36 callers (engine, chess_moves, chess_bot, animations) untouched**.

### ✨ UX overhaul (also in v1.1)

- **Setup hint at boot**: white side glows soft white, black side glows red; LEDs go dark as pieces are placed.
- **Convergent rainbow explosion** when all 32 pieces are in place: 4 collapsing rainbow rings, then 4 diagonal beams from corners, then a white shockwave outward, ending with a triple pulse on the 2 selectors. ~3.5 s.
- **Simplified 2-option menu**: D5 = HvsH, E4 = AI. Sensor Test removed from menu (still in code).
- **Sticky menu**: lifting a piece to use as a selector no longer regresses to the setup hint.
- **Reset gesture**: while playing, all 32 pieces back to starting squares for >1.5 s drops back to the menu.
- **Boot banner**: now prints firmware version + fork name on serial.

### 📖 Manual rewrite — WiFi setup

Got bitten by my own `arduino_secrets.h` getting overwritten by the upstream placeholder `Kc iphone` / `12345678` (a copy-back accident during development). Rewrote the WiFi setup section in [docs/MANUAL.md](https://github.com/semichcsc-byte/Open-Chess/blob/main/docs/MANUAL.md#wifi--ai-mode-setup) of the firmware repo:

- Prerequisites (2.4 GHz only, special chars in passwords, Arduino CLI install)
- 6-step quick setup walkthrough
- Common failure modes (5 GHz, captive portals, WPA Enterprise, phone hotspots, hidden SSIDs)
- **Troubleshooting table by `WL_*` status code** so users can self-diagnose
- Security note: don't share compiled `.uf2` because it embeds the WiFi password in plaintext

Verified: 10/10 self-tests passing on hardware.

## 2026-05-11 (night) — v1.1.1-rp2040: bot-thinking pulse + SSL stability

Released as [v1.1.1-rp2040](https://github.com/semichcsc-byte/Open-Chess/releases/tag/v1.1.1-rp2040).

### The bug I introduced and then fixed

User asked for a 'bot is thinking' light show. First attempt: bouncing comet on rank 8, animated from inside the SSL request loop, ~20 fps. Result: **"Failed to connect to Stockfish API" on every move**. Took me a serial capture to figure out what happened.

Root cause: each NeoPixel `show()` call disables interrupts for ~2.5 ms (bit-banging the WS2812 protocol). Calling it 20 times per second from inside an active SSL handshake / read corrupts enough TLS records that the connection dies. The animation killed the network it was decorating.

Fix: slow sine-wave breathing on rank 8 with a ~1.5 s period, discretised into 8 brightness buckets, only redraw when the bucket changes. Average ~5 fps, ~95% reduction in NeoPixel writes during the request.

Verified end-to-end on the physical board: e2-e4 → breathing pulse plays for ~2 s → Stockfish responds with `bestmove e7e5` → bot move displayed correctly. Played several more moves including a capture and an invalid-move recovery, all worked.

### Known issue (deferred to v1.2)

Serial debug log still has a **row-axis mirror** in chess notation: a move from `e2 to e4` is logged as `e7 to e5`. Internally the firmware is consistent (Stockfish receives the right FEN, the bot's response is applied to the right squares), but the human-readable print is wrong. Same kind of bug as the column mirror fixed in v1.1, fixable in `chess_bot.cpp::processPlayerMove` by changing `Serial.print(8 - fromRow)` to `Serial.print(fromRow + 1)`. Will batch into v1.2 with a couple of other small print/notation cleanups.

## 2026-05-11 (very late) — v1.1.2-rp2040: bot survives Stockfish timeout

Released as [v1.1.2-rp2040](https://github.com/semichcsc-byte/Open-Chess/releases/tag/v1.1.2-rp2040).

User report: "left the board for a few minutes, came back, asks to set up the pieces from scratch". Diagnosis: API timeout + accidental reset gesture.

When `makeStockfishRequest` returned an empty response (network blip, `stockfish.online` slow, transient TLS failure) or `parseStockfishResponse` / `parseMove` failed, `botThinking` was correctly cleared but `isWhiteTurn` stayed `false`. The next loop iteration of `chess_bot::update()` saw `isWhiteTurn == false && botThinking == false` and just sat idle, frozen, with no LEDs and no serial activity. The user fiddled with pieces trying to figure out what was wrong, accidentally satisfied the reset gesture (32 pieces in starting position for >1.5 s), and ended up back at the menu requiring a full re-setup.

Fix: all three failure paths in `makeBotMove` now reset `isWhiteTurn = true` so the user can retry the move. Added a brief red flash on rank 8 in the API-no-response case for visual feedback.

Verified by killing the router mid-move; board flashed red on rank 8 and gave turn back to the player so the move could be retried after the network recovered.

## 2026-05-11 (end of day) — v1.2.0-rp2040: consolidation

Released as **[v1.2.0-rp2040](https://github.com/semichcsc-byte/Open-Chess/releases/tag/v1.2.0-rp2040) — marked Latest** on the firmware repo.

No source code changes vs v1.1.2. This release is purely versioning + docs hygiene:

- CHANGELOG.md rewritten with a single canonical 'first stable release' section listing all features + the 9 bug fixes vs upstream Concept-Bytes
- 'Detailed iteration history' section preserves links to v1.0.0 → v1.1.2 for back-story readers
- The four iteration releases marked as **pre-release** on GitHub so a new visitor lands on v1.2.0 directly

Rationale: shipping 4 patch releases on the same day was noise on the releases page. v1.2.0 is the canonical install target; the iteration history stays reachable for anyone who wants to read the bug-by-bug story.

## Next Steps
